# Yo! 👋 I'm Eeman Majumder
Yup I just code a little: [![wakatime](https://wakatime.com/badge/user/8a36fe61-0e5d-4a3d-a554-d460dfdd3cd3.svg)](https://wakatime.com/@8a36fe61-0e5d-4a3d-a554-d460dfdd3cd3)
## I Make AIs For Fun. 

### [Check out my weird AI musings on Medium](https://eeman1113.github.io/)

I'm just your average nerd with a passion for AI and Machine Learning. Currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science with a specialization in AIML at VIT Bhopal, India. 

My friends and family are used to me coming up with bizarre AI projects that leave them scratching their heads. But hey, that's what makes life fun, right? 😉

And many, many more weird and wonderful AI projects that will make you go "WTF?" 😂

### Experience and Achievements 📜

I've worked with some cool companies and organizations like Manuscripts.ai, Omdena, AI Club - VIT Bhopal, Medium, Analytics India Magazine, and more. I've also spoken at events, mentored at hackathons, and contributed to open-source projects like YOLO V5 and The Algorithms.

Oh, and I've done well in competitive coding too (Google Code Jam, Kickstart, HackerRank, etc.). But let's be real, that's not nearly as interesting as my weird AI projects. 🤓

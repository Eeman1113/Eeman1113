Welcome to my little corner of the internet! **I'm Eeman Majumder**, a self-proclaimed average nerd with a passion for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I'm currently pursuing my B.Tech degree in Computer Science with a specialization in AIML at VIT Bhopal, India.

I'm known for making some weird and interesting AI projects that have left my friends and family scratching their heads. But hey, that's what makes life fun, right? üòâ

Now, let me tell you a bit about myself in a more down-to-earth way.

**Academic Projects**

<em>**Street Dogs Detection And Management Artificial Intelligence - Web App**</em>
--------------------------------------------------
Aug 2022 - Oct 2022

Associated with Vellore Institute of Technology

<b><h3>Description Of This Project:</h3></b>

The "Dawg Detection" app is a web-based application designed for identifying the presence of dogs in a given image. The app utilizes the state-of-the-art YOLOv7 object detection algorithm to accurately detect the presence of dogs in images uploaded by users.

The app provides users with a simple and intuitive interface to upload an image, which is then processed using the YOLOv7 algorithm to detect the presence of dogs. The app then displays the image with bounding boxes around each detected dog, along with a count of the total number of dogs detected in the image.

In addition to identifying dogs in uploaded images, the app also uses geolocation services to plot the user's location on a map and provides an estimate of the total number of dog sightings reported around the world.

The app also includes a fun feature for users to click a button to trigger a shower of balloons to celebrate their successful use of the app.

Overall, the "Dawg Detection" app is a fun and useful tool for anyone looking to identify dogs in images and gain insight into dog sightings worldwide.

<em>**ML Based Career Councillor**</em>
--------------------------------------------------
Sep 2022 - Feb 2023

Associated with Vellore Institute of Technology

<b><h3>Description Of This Project:</h3></b>
The ML Based Career Counsellor is a Streamlit app that uses large language models to suggest job positions based on the user's skills. The app asks the user to enter their name, region, date of birth and select the skills they possess from a list of skills. It then generates a prompt using the user's selected skills and asks large language models to suggest ten job positions based on the user's skills.

The app uses the PIL library to create a report containing the user's name, selected skills, and the suggested job positions. The report is generated as an image and saved to the local file system.

<em>**Ansar Chan (‚óï„ÉÆ‚óï) Ëß£**</em>
--------------------------------------------------

Description Of Project:

Have you ever had a list of questions that you needed to answer quickly? Maybe you're a teacher or a student preparing for an exam, or maybe you're just curious about a particular topic. Either way, answering a long list of questions can be a daunting task. Fortunately, there is a new tool that can help: Ansar Chan (‚óï„ÉÆ‚óï) Ëß£.

Ansar Chan (‚óï„ÉÆ‚óï) Ëß£ is a Streamlit app that uses OpenAI to generate answers to a list of questions. It takes an array of questions as input and generates an answer for each one using OpenAI's text-generation API. The app then displays the answers in a visually appealing format.

To use Ansar Chan (‚óï„ÉÆ‚óï) Ëß£, you first need to run the app on Streamlit. Once the app loads, enter an array of questions into the text input field and click "Enter". The app will use the OpenAI API to generate answers for each question and display them in a visually appealing format.
